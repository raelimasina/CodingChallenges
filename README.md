# Coding Challenges
This repo is a collection of coding challenges that I have completed. Some are from CodeWars, some from LeetCode, and some are small practice problems I came across. The tech that is primarily used in these challenges is JavaScript.

## Optimizations:
In the future, I hope to branch out to other languages such as Python and Go.

## Lessons Learned:
I have really enjoyed doing a daily coding challenge as it solidifies my understanding of different concepts, gives me an opportunity to have fun with algorithms, and allows me to learn from other coders who have solved the same problem in different ways.
